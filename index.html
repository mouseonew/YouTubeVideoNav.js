            <p>
                I hear these hateful voices in my head too cowardly to face me and engage my eardrums with speech as biology, God, or mother nature intended.
                They keep me awake sometimes for days on end. They give me ideations of various sorts from suicidal, paranoid, hypochondriac, delusional,
                and depressive. They speak of people I know or have known, weaving stories about others which I cannot verify or did not experience or hear of from them.
                They talk of religions, philosophy, ideologies, and history but distort it or misrepresent what I think or say. However I express myself they twist it
                up in the worst possible fashion as if I can comprehend how a world with more than 7 billion people would perceive my speech. Sometimes it even feels like
                they can read my thoughts inducing an obsessive racing state of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing has worked to drown out these voices from earplugs to turning on multiple sources of audio, sleep remedies of various sorts, and even medication.
                I believe I have a new sensory organ that is being overstimulated, sensory overload or torture including sleep deprivation. It seems nobody can
                explain adequately what I'm experiencing which is odd living in a country with some of the best and brightest people in the world. Instead I'm lead to believe
                in some sort of "magic" with makeshift solutions. It's really disheartening that someone like me whose embraced freedom as defined and taught in America and
                who believes firmly in the scientific method has grown into mid adulthood to find out that what we are taught may be a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
                In these recording I express how the voices I hear affect me but I don't speak directly of what they speak of, I try to be vague. I mock or ridicule
                them and poke fun once in a while. I am putting on an impersonation because I don't want my natural voice on the internet. This is not my natural progression in life
                or my destiny, I don't want to be doing this and I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't hear voices in my head. I have my own mind and personality despite my occupied
                brain by other personalities who I can only assume hate me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been experiencing this for 5 years and counting. I experienced hearing voices briefly on occasion before this but it wasn't nonstop daily chatter.
                They say I have a mental illness and they say I don't, schizophrenia.

                    <div>I woke up this morning hearing mostly this voice speak nonstop while a few other authoritative voices chimed in once in a while. I decided to make a simulation, it's not quite what I hear but close enough. This voice will appear on occasion, it's very frustrating to wake up to this and hear it into the afternoon and evening. It creates a state of mind of impending doom, that someone is sad or suffering and I don't know who or what I can do about it. I'm suffering as well, all I want in life is to not hear voices anymore.</div>

                        <p>UPDATE: Trying to make it gentler while still communicating the effect</p>

                        <p>I've tried to recreate with this video what it's like to hear voices. The computer voice is much more pleasant than what I hear, less coherent, no emotional inflection, less specific, and clearer. Often the voices will start a sentence and not finish it spurring the imagination. It is not always easy to put together the phrases and words I hear. They are fuzzy, patterned like speech, and bassy. My brain is stuck trying to decipher this nonstop noise, oddly it goes away for days or weeks on a rare occasion for no reason that I can comprehend. Try it out all day long and go to bed to it if you want to walk in my shoes. Then do it for years. My routine is rather erratic as you could imagine.</p>

                        <p>I'm surprised to find that this program is a welcome distraction from what I hear in my own head and can be humorous. I've had trouble finding good background noise distractions in the media and I want to explore this more.</p>

                        <p>UPDATE: It sort of has multiple personalities but it could be seen more as moods or states of mind. I ran the recording on my laptop, it gets sluggish in spots while the aglorithm is running. It's annoying to see it not as fluid as it could be but in a way it's representative of my condition because it was inspired by my condition.</p>

                        <p>I'm surprised to find that this program is a welcome distraction from what I hear in my own head and can be humorous. I've had trouble finding good background noise distractions in the media and I want to explore this more.</p>

The computer voice is much more pleasant than what I hear, less coherent, no emotional inflection, less specific, and clearer. Often the voices will start a sentence and not finish it spurring the imagination. It is not always easy to put together the phrases and words I hear.
